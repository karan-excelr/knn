# knn
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, non-parametric classification and regression technique. It classifies data based on the majority label of the "k" nearest data points in the feature space. KNN uses distance metrics (like Euclidean) to find these neighbors and is sensitive to the choice of k and distance measure.
